# DemeterEye

🏆 Winner of the **“Best Use of Data”** award at NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 (Seattle)

DemeterEye is an iOS mobile application that helps farmers monitor the health and phenology of their fields using NASA Earth observation data.  
By combining satellite vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI) with climate data, the app provides farmers with simple, actionable insights:
- Track field greenness and seasonal growth history  
- View summaries and predictions related to crop flowering and yield potential  

## Features
- Login and manage multiple fields  
- Seasonal summaries with start and peak season dates  
- Integration with satellite and climate data sources  

## About
This project was developed as part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
It is a proof-of-concept tool designed to make complex NASA Earth observation datasets accessible and useful for smallholder farmers worldwide.
